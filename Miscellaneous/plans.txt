Rough Plan: 
Idea 1:Input a picture of an animal and it tells what animal it is. Might Require a database for training.
Idea 2: Input the name of an animal and it finds a picture of that animal.
Idea 3: You can input either an animal picture or a text of an animal and we want an entire description of the animal. And More...

Expectations: 
Finalized: 3rd Idea
1. Web application for uploading a picture or a text entry with an enter/submit form button.
2. This should redirect us to a page that should generate the information of the animal, and potentially it's breed.
3. Find a database containing animals.
4. The main file should be trained by the database of the animals and the breeds, which would generate the name of the animal and the breed.
5. Try using Wikipedia API to get the information of the animal/breed.

Plans:
Kartavya: Create the front-end of the web application and create a generic back-end
Shivam: Create a generic use of wikipedia API, and work on front-end of the web application
